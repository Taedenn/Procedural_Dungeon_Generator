A simple script to create an auto-tiled procedural dungeon in Godot! Easy to implement for  your own personal projects!


Instructions:

- To use in your godot project, unzip auto_tile_procedural_dungeon.zip, and place in your project. 
- auto_tile.tscn shows how you might set up the procedural dungeon generator,
  but you may also simply reconfigure the TileMapLayer to use your own assets.
  Just make sure terrain_set and terrain match up with your TileSet configuration!
  grid_size in auto_tile.gd will also automatically update your TileSet size!
